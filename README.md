This is a messy github, but my first stab at a Kaggle competition.  This was quite useful in helping me explore python Pandas Dataframes which are pretty impressive and working with SQL analogues in python.  I also explored some python scikit learn data processing tools by trying LabelEncoder and OneHotEncoding and testing the differences.  Lastly, I tried a few different machine learning algorithms from scikit learn and xgboost (which was tricky to install on a windows machine).  I placed around the 50% mark in the final accounting on the challenge using Feat2wXGB.
